## Overview
This document outlines the planning for Stage 2 of the EmuBiz project, focusing on multi-currency scope decisions, exchange rate sources, timeline options, and the decision framework to guide progress.

## Multi-Currency Scope Decisions
1. **Currency Selection**: Determine which currencies will be supported based on user demographics and market analysis.
2. **Conversion Mechanism**: Choose whether to use fixed rates, real-time rates, or a combination.
3. **User Preferences**: Include options for users to select their preferred currency for transactions.

## Exchange Rate Sources

2. **Data Frequency**: Decide on the frequency of updates (e.g., real-time, hourly, daily).
3. **Historical Data Access**: Consider requirements for accessing historical currency exchange data for reporting purposes.

## Timeline Options
1. **Project Milestones**: Define key milestones for the duration of Stage 2, including deadlines for features related to currency management.
2. **Testing Period**: Allocate time for user testing of multi-currency functionality before full deployment.
3. **Deployment Schedule**: Plan the rollout of changes to minimize disruption to users.

## Decision Framework
1. **Stakeholder Input**: Gather input from key stakeholders to inform decisions on currency-related features.
2. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate the impact of each decision on user experience and system performance.
3. **Review Process**: Establish a review process for decisions affecting the multi-currency implementation.

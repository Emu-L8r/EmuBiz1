## 📞 WHAT TO DO IF YOU GET STUCK

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: Can't find 🐛 button**
→ It should be in the top-right corner of the screen
→ If missing, the debug mode might not be active
→ Continue anyway - checkpoint will show ❌ FAIL

**Issue: App crashes during testing**
→ Note which checkpoint/test it happened on
→ Record in Phase 3
→ Continue with next test
→ Report all crashes in final report

**Issue: PDF won't open**
→ Go back to CHECKPOINT 4
→ Try clicking the invoice again
→ If it still won't open, record as ❌ FAIL
→ Continue with Phase 2 anyway (analyze what's there)

**Issue: Can't take screenshots**
→ On emulator: Ctrl+S or use Android Studio's screenshot tool
→ On device: Volume Down + Power
→ If can't get screenshots, describe observations in text instead
